# Natural-Languade-Model-Project
This is a small NLM project i've done for my NLM course assignment.
Contains code on how to extract data from a .csv and .txt file.
Demonstrates tokenisation,normalisation and removal of stop words,lemmatisation,computing the frequency of a word and webscraping.
I have also attached the datasets that i have used, there are comments in the code where changes have to be made to make it suitable for your dataset.
